### Description

Solving real world data science tasks by automating this common data science task will save you hours of work. I'll cover how to write a python script to import a CSV or Excel file to a database, automate the entire process, and apply software development fundamentals for scale and reuseability so that you can share with your team and use on other projects

Specifically be showing you how to import a CSV file to a postgres database on AWS. Importing CSV files to a database is a common task needed for data science and analytics and it can be done completely with python using pandas dataframes, numpy, os library, and the posgres database wrapper psycopg2.
